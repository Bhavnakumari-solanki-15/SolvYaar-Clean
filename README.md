# Fluvio Collaborative Features Setup

To set up and use the collaborative features with Fluvio in WSL Ubuntu:

## Prerequisites

1. Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) with Ubuntu installed
2. Fluvio installed in your WSL Ubuntu environment

## Installation Steps for Fluvio in WSL

1. Open a WSL terminal (Ubuntu)
2. Install Fluvio CLI:
   ```bash
   curl -fsS https://packages.fluvio.io/v1/install.sh | bash
   ```
3. Add Fluvio to your PATH:
   ```bash
   export PATH="$HOME/.fluvio/bin:$PATH"
   ```
   Add this line to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` for permanent setup.
4. Start a local Fluvio cluster:
   ```bash
   fluvio cluster start
   ```

## Running the Collaborative Server

From your Windows environment, run:

```bash
npm run server:collab
```

This script will:
1. Detect your WSL environment
2. Find the WSL IP address
3. Update the `.env` file with the correct WSL IP
4. Start Fluvio if it's not already running
5. Start the collaborative server with Fluvio integration

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Make sure Fluvio is installed in WSL:
   ```bash
   wsl which fluvio
   ```

2. Check if Fluvio cluster is running:
   ```bash
   wsl fluvio cluster status
   ```

3. Manually start Fluvio if needed:
   ```bash
   wsl fluvio cluster start
   ```

4. Get your WSL IP address:
   ```bash
   wsl hostname -I
   ```
   The first IP address should be used for `VITE_FLUVIO_WSL_IP` in your `.env` file.
